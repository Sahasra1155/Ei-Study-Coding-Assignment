Design Patterns Implementation (Exercise 1)
Overview
This repository contains implementations for various software design patterns, each with different use cases to demonstrate practical understanding. The patterns showcased include behavioral, creational, and structural design patterns. The examples are implemented using Java, focusing on showing the correct use and benefits of each pattern.

Design Patterns Covered

Behavioral Design Patterns:
Interpreter Pattern
Observer Pattern

Creational Design Patterns:
Builder Pattern
Factory Pattern

Structural Design Patterns:
Adapter Pattern
Bridge Pattern


Satellite Command System (Exercise 2)
Overview
The Satellite Command System is a console-based application designed to simulate the operation and control of a satellite. It allows users to issue commands to rotate the satellite, manage solar panels, and collect data in orbit. This system demonstrates various software design patterns, emphasizing flexibility, scalability, and adherence to SOLID principles.

The core goal of this project is to demonstrate command pattern usage and practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage state and execute commands on the satellite system.

Key Features
Rotate the Satellite: Rotate the satellite to a specific orientation (North, South, East, West).
Activate/Deactivate Solar Panels: Control the status of solar panels, allowing or restricting power generation.
Collect Data: Collect data while the solar panels are active, simulating satellite operations.

Design Pattern used are:
Command Pattern
Invoker Pattern
Singleton Pattern
Factory Pattern
